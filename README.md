# Reactjs-app
After my Reactjs intensive course, this was my first React App.
It has a menu which contains the Weather button, Preset Locations button, Todo List button Linkedin profiles button and About button.
I used webpack to create the bundle of this app, and the app functions as follows:-

Weather: This uses the openWeatherMap API to collect the teamperature data of ant country, state or city entered in the text field.

Present Location: There are some already specified country names that when clicked it automatically take one to the weather page
                  and display the temparature of the country.
                  
                 
Todo list: In this view one is able to add a task to the view, edit the task and also Delete it.

Linkedin Profile: This view is used to extract linkedin details is induvidual by entering the person's Linkedin username.
                  It displays the picture( if any) get the full name, email, number of git reposes, company and location. I used
                  github API to implement this aspect of the app.
